# Quiz App (Flutter)

The app allows the user to start a quiz, then navigate various Flutter-related questions, where the possible answers are actually displayed in random order, and once you went through all questions. You get a summary screen where you can see which questions were answered correctly and which ones were answered incorrectly and you can restart the quiz
